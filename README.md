# busca-cinema-backend

This is the repository dedicated to be the backend to the [busca-cinema](https://github.com/Jefferson227/busca-cinema) project. Here I give some shots on nodejs with express and even some web scrapping with cheeriojs.

## Location

There are different branches for specific locations:
* `master` for brazilian cities
* `feature/tribute` for canadian cities

## Setup

Install the dependencies
```sh
$ npm i
```

Run
```sh

```
